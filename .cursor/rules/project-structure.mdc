- There are three fundamental levels of abstraction for UI components
  - domain-agnostic design system components (atoms, molecules) are placed in the ui folder
  - feature-specific components (organisms) are placed in the features folder
  - pages are composed of features in the pages folder
- Astro files should NOT be used for components, only routes, and therefore are only used in the pages folder. We do this to avoid too much lock-in.
- we try to scope independent features in their own feature folder. So the folder at `src/features` only has folders as direct children which each represent specific features.
- import from features and ui from the base url like `import {} from "src/features/...";`
